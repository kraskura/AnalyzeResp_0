Welcome! 

This is “AnalyzeResp,” a developing set of functions (one day, hoping to call it a package in R). 

The development of these functions presents a self-learning, passion-driven journey, which began as one file with few functions aiming to develop a consistent way to analyze our experimental data. It then began to grow larger, and the functionality continued to grow. 

We continue to use it, find ways to debug it and make it better.
This would not be possible without the valuable feedback and support from everyone in the Eliason Lab and collaborators.  

**Transparent and honest work is our priority** While this is not packaged working library, it is open to use and further development. Please note the code of conduct below.

**Questions, feedback, and suggestions are always welcome and are much appreciated**

Please check out the GitHub pages website developed to document our functions and provide demo examples using these functions.
