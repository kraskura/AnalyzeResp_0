# AnalyzeResp_0

This is AnalyzeResp, a developing set of function (one day hoping to call it a package in R). This is a project that started as one file with few functions in R customise to analyse collected experimental data. It then began to grow into a more comprehensive package, and it continues to grow to this day. We continue to use it and while using it, new tools, capabilities are added to the function. 
The maintenance and development of R script is lead by Krista Kraskura, a PhD Candidate at UCSB, but this would not be possible without the valuable feedback and support from the [Erika Eliason's Lab](www.erikaeliason.com) and collaborators. 

**Trasnparent and open source work is our priority** While this is not packaged working library, this is my first attempt to make it available and citable. My forefront most important task under this project is to re-work the organisation of all functions and make the package installable via Github. 

**Questions, feedback, suggestions are always welcome and much appreciated**

Please check out the github pages website that was developed to being documenting our functions and to provide demo examples using these functions.
