- MO~2~: Oxygen consumption uptake rate (a proxy for metabolic rate); often mgO~2~ min^-1 
- MR: Metabolic Rate
- SMR: Standard Metabolic Rate, the minimum MR to maintain basic bodilly functions, to sustain life
- RMR: Resting Metabolic Rate (higher than SMR, often when some of the requirements for SMR are not met)
- MMR: Maximum Metabolic Rate, the highest MR measured
- AS: (also AAS), Absolute Aerobic Scope (AAS = MMR - SMR); the energy capacity to perform activities above resting levels
- EPOC: Excess Post-exercise Oxygen Consumption, metabolic recovery (characterised by time and metabolic cost metrics)
- Time[MMR50]: the time it takes to recover metabolic rates to 50% of the measured MMR.
- SDA: Specific Dynamic Action, or metabolism associated with digestion (contains time and metabolic cost metrics)

<h4 style="color:#325d88; font-weight: bold;  text-align: left"> An overview of respirometry trial </h4>

The recorded MO~2~ measurements overnight on automatic cycle (e.g., 5:10, measure: flush, Figure 3) are all used to obtain i) SMR and/or RMR, ii) and recovery performance when the experiment begins with measuring MMR (Figure 2). EPOC represents the recovery costs (the area in between the measured MO~2~ during recovery and the `epoc_threshold` most commonly estimated SMR or RMR). A defined trend connecting each MO~2~ measurement is needed to estimate EPOC. This trend tracks each point directly, or it can be smoothed at different levels using `spar_levels` arg in the `MMR_SMR_AS_EPOC` function. The smoothing can be useful to minimize the effects of sporadic measurements while capturing the biologically representative metabolic rate trend of an animal.

<h4 style="color:#325d88; font-weight: bold;  text-align: left"> Measuring MMR in four individuals on manual time control</h4>

There are several experimental approaches to measuring MMR. Figure 2 shows one method where MMR is measured one individual at a time, in four individuals. In the provided example, it is assumed that these four individuals or respirometers are connected with one FireSting oxygen sensor, and one O~2~ probe per respirometer. Therefore, one raw-data file will contain O~2~, time, and temperature, at all times for each respirometer. Using an 8-channel Firesting, each respirometer may be connected to one temperature probe.

The oxygen levels in each respirometer are recorded continuously, but the MMR is measured in sequence in one animal at a time. The figure's annotations can guide how these data are analyzed using the "AnalyzeResp" functions.

In Figure 2, the arrows point to time points where flush pump turns on or off (Figure 3) depending of the measurument cycle progression. These times are experiment- and user-defined and are input as arguments in `MMR` and `SMR` functions accordingly.

<h5 style="color:#325d88; font-weight: bold;  text-align: left"> Measuring MO~2~ with automatic timer control</h5>

Below is an example of changing oxygen levels in the respirometry chamber that is set to automated repeat closed (measure) and open (flush) cycles. This measurement pattern often continues overnight, producing several dozen oxygen uptake rate (MO~2~) measurement cycles.

SMR (and RMR) is an estimated metric calculated from all high-quality MO~2 recorded during the trial. In Figure 3, AS  = air saturation.
