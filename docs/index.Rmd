>This is a site for developing set of R function, which we called "AnalyzeResp" (one day we are hoping to call AnalyzeResp a formally published package in R). This is a project that started as a signle R file containing a few custom written functions to analyse experimentally collected oxygen consumption data in fish, or any aquatic animals. This is an active project: the outputs are modified and revised to improve clarity and their visual presentation, while the inputs to each function are streamlined to improve user experience. We are very encouraged that the community using these functions is growing and strive to provide a positive experience to everyone. 

The maintenance and development of all R scripts is lead by Krista Kraskura, a PhD Candidate at UCSB. However, this would not be possible without the valuable advice and support from the [Erika Eliason's Lab](www.erikaeliason.com) and many of her collaborators. Special thanks to Emily Hardison, Terra Dressler, Jacey Van Wert, Samantha Csik, and Dr. Erika Eliason.

<div class="well">
Trasnparent and open source work is our priority. Although, this is not a formally formatted R package, nor is publish by CRAN, here we share all functions (R script) for everyone's use. We provide documentation for functions, troubleshooting page, and supplementary background information to facility the use of these functions. 

As a maintainer and developer, my priorities for this project include: 1) improving the functions, specifically focusing on streamlinig the inputs and outputs, and 2) to make the set of functions installable directly via Github, and submit this work to be published on CRAN.

Our analysis incorporates approaches described by Chabot, D., Steffensen, J. F. and Farrell, A. P. (2016) The determination of the standard metabolic rate in fishes. Journal of Fish Biology 88, 81-121.

We are inspired by the work by many package developers in this field of study and encourage checking out these packages and functions in R:

- **RespR** by Januar Harianto & Nicholas Carey [Web](https://januarharianto.github.io/respR/index.html)
- **respirometry** by Matthew A. Birk [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/respirometry/index.html)
- **fishMO2** by Denis Chabot [GitHub](https://github.com/denis-chabot/fishMO2)
- **rMR** by Tyler L. Moulton [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rMR/index.html)

<h4 style="color:#495057; font-weight: bold;  text-align: left">Get started</h4> 

- Fork the repository from [GitHub](https://github.com/kraskura/AnalyzeResp_0) directly. Or download an R script with all functions: [https://github.com/kraskura/AnalyzeResp_0.git](https://github.com/kraskura/AnalyzeResp_0.git)
- Use the demo tutorials to guide data analyses. An annotated R script with example sequence of analysis is available in the Git repository.
- Use the troubleshooting page for help.
- Emails, or posts directly on GitHub repository page are welcome and encouraged when getting stuck at any steps.
- Similarly, I will greatly appreciate any feedback, and suggestions to improve this work.

- Please cite the GitHub Repository when using any of the functions.
- We also suggest citing two methods papers that we used to guide the work:
    - Chabot, D., Steffensen, J. F. and Farrell, A. P. (2016) The determination of the standard metabolic rate in fishes. Journal of Fish Biology 88, 81-121. 
    - Little, A.G., Dressler, T., Kraskura, K., Hardison, E., Hendriks, B., Prystay, T., Farrell, A.P., Cooke, S.J., Patterson, D.A., Hinch, S.G., Eliason, E.J., 2020.

- Lasty, we will appreciate if you reach out when using our functions, and your work will be added to the <a href="./references.html" >reference list</a> Thank you!

<h4 style="color:#495057; font-weight: bold;  text-align: left"> For who and for what is AnalyzeResp for? </h4>

For who: The functions are for anyone using aquatic respirometry in their work.
Our script is writtem to analyze data that was measured using [Firesting multichannel](https://www.pyroscience.com/en/263) oxygen sensors from Pyroscience. The script can be easily adapted to be compatible with any other setup (demos on how to achieve this coming soon!).

A quick overview of AnalyzeResp: Once the oxygen consumption rates are recorded in any aquatic animal using respiromatery, it's time to use these finctions. The raw (.txt) export files from the Firesting complementary software can be directly provided to our first function, which will strip it down to a few essential components required to obtain metabolic rates in an animal. Then several functions (in a specific sequence) can be used to estimate oxygen consumption rates, or metabolic performances (oxygen consumption is a proxy of metabolic rate). Then all compiled metabolic rate measurements are used to specifically estimate different ecologically valuable performances: Maximum metabolic rates, Standard (and Resting) metabolic rates, Routine Metabolic rates, Absolute Aerobic scope, Recovery performance, and Digestions Costs and Time. 

**Strengths?** i) Ability to visualize all data in detail and at all analysis steps. ii) perform user specific quality control, track progress, make work reproducible using R script. iii) all input and output files can be saved locally in a user-specified directory (default, optional).

**Imported libraries:** 
```
rMR, ggplot2, gridExtra, chron, lubridate, dplyr, pryr, ggpubr, magrittr, tidyr ,broom, purrr, mclust, data.table, stringr, DescTools
